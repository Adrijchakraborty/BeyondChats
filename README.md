# BeyondChats - Chatbot Integration Platform

## Overview
BeyondChats is a chatbot integration platform that allows users to set up and integrate a chatbot on their website. The platform provides a seamless UI/UX for configuring company details, monitoring website scraping progress, testing the chatbot, and integrating it into the client's website. The project is built using **ReactJS** and focuses on **responsiveness and user-friendly design**.

## Features
### **Company Setup**
- Users can enter company details (name, website URL, and description).
- Auto-fetch meta description from the provided website URL (bonus feature).

### **Website Scraping Progress**

- Users can click on a webpage to view the scraped data chunks.

### **Chatbot Testing**
- A dummy chatbot UI is provided for testing.
- Users can share feedback if the chatbot is not working as intended.

### **Chatbot Integration**
Two integration options:
1. **Copy-paste a code snippet** into the website's `<head>`.
2. **Mail integration instructions** to the client's developer.
- Test integration to verify successful setup.

### **Integration Success/Failure UI**
- **Success UI**: Displays confetti animation, success message, and options to explore the admin panel, start talking to the chatbot, and share on social media.
- **Failure UI**: Displays an error message and a "Try Again" button.
